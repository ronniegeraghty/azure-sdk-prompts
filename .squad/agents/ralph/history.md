## 2026-04-17: Phase 4 Verified — Ready for v0.3.1 Release

Morpheus 🕶️ completed Phase 4 dogfood verification (6/6 checks PASSED, zero blockers). All subsystems verified: build, live eval, comparison auto-generation, serve endpoints, hierarchical criteria, cleanup. Recommendation: **Promote dev → main and cut v0.3.1 tag.**

### 2026-04-23: Learnings — Squad Default Model = claude-opus-4.7

- **Model default:** Every squad agent (including Scribe and Ralph) now runs on **claude-opus-4.7** until the user clears the preference. Set via `defaultModel` in `.squad/config.json`. Layer 0 override — beats Layer 3 task-aware selection.
- **Source:** User directive 2026-04-23; merged into `.squad/decisions.md`.

## 2026-04-24T06:00Z: TEAM DIRECTIVE — Work on `ronniegeraghty/dev`

**By:** Ronnie (User directive captured by Copilot)  
**Status:** Active

Going forward, the team works directly on the `ronniegeraghty/dev` branch with frequent commit points. No more transient feature branches like `ronniegeraghty/prompt-grader-checks` for in-flight squad work — merge to dev and keep moving.

**Rationale:** User request — streamline workflow, reduce branch proliferation, enable continuous integration of squad work.

**Action:** Update your local branch strategy. All future work targets dev with regular commits.

## 2026-04-24: 🚨 Team default model is now claude-opus-4.7

Per `.squad/config.json` (`defaultModel: claude-opus-4.7`) and the standing policy at the top of `.squad/decisions.md`:

- **Every agent spawn defaults to `claude-opus-4.7`.**
- **`claude-haiku-4.5` is FORBIDDEN.** Even if your charter says "preferred: claude-haiku-4.5", that line is overridden. No Haiku, ever.
- **`claude-sonnet-4.5`** (latest Sonnet) is allowed only for trivial mechanical work where opus-4.7 would be wasteful.
- This affects what every future spawn looks like — expect opus-4.7 as your model.

- **Windows filenames:** Never use `:` in any filename. For ISO 8601 timestamps, use hyphens: `2026-04-24T23-58-37Z` not `2026-04-24T23:58:37Z`. Commit 8148ba13 renamed 83 files. See `.squad/decisions.md` and `.squad/skills/windows-compatibility/SKILL.md`.
